# nasawakeupcalls.data

Data extracts and analysis from the NASA wake-up call project. This is a remix
project. Source Data is licensed to NASA. If NASA would like to commit to a
creative-commons license for this work to be used more widely, that would be
lovely.

Credit for the source material goes to Colin Fries of the NASA historical
division.

## Process and Requirements

When there is an opportunity I will walk people back through the process and
requirements too. I started but as the process of converting the data from
PDF to JSON continued it became more and more difficult - it was not
straightforward.

I will also list the tools and the order to run them.

I will follow up!

## Questions without answers

I have questions I want to meditate on:

* Has the process been lossless?
* Has the source material been diluted?
* Is the transformative nature of this work worth it?
* It was expensive, how expensive was it?
* How would these costs compare to those in my subject discipline of
  digital-preservation?
* Does this work fit in the digital-humanities?
* Is it sustainable?
* Would I do it again??? (Yes, but after a holiday!)

## What next?

* Playlists! And greater access to the data.
* I want to find more tools to explore the data with.
	* Visdata looks great! http://visidata.org/
* I will start to edit the data using source control as a way of managing those
  edits.

## Please do

Visit https://nasawakeupcalls.github.io/ and enjoy what's there for now. Please
let me know how it can be expanded upon.

If you're NASA and don't want to sue me! Please also say hi! I would love to
work with you.
