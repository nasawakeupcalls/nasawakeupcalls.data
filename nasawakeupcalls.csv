1969-07-20,APOLLO,APOLLO 11,Frank Sinatra,Fly Me To The Moon,"Various sources note that Fly Me to the Moon was played by Aldrin when he stepped foot on the moon. One has Sinatra relaying the news to Jones while he was on holiday in Marbella. An alternative telling of the story, the cutest I can find, is from the New York Times published November 18, 1990, by Diane K. Shah: ""MY NAME IS DR. ALDRIN,"" THE man said. He had come up to Jones at a party in Sun Valley, Idaho, two, three years ago, a distinguished looking man in a white military jacket covered with medals. ""We worked together before,"" he added, ""but we'll talk about it later."" Mystified, Jones asked someone who the man was. ""Why that's Buzz Aldrin,"" came the reply. Later, the astronaut came up to Jones again. He said that just as he was getting ready to step off the spacecraft, he reached back and took the cassette of ""Fly Me to the Moon"" that Jones had arranged and conducted for Count Basie and Frank Sinatra, and he played it. ""The first music played on the moon,"" Jones says. I freaked."" ...The astronauts since Apollo 7 were equipped with a Sony TC-50 casette player for recording mission logs, but they also took mix-tapes with them to space. Fly Me to the Moon may very well have been the first human music played from an extraterrestrial surface.""",Pop,,,,https://www.discogs.com/Frank-Sinatra-Fly-Me-To-The-Moon/release/10855629

At 7:00a.m. it was traditional for students with hi-fi systems to tie them together and wake up everybody in the undergraduate dorms by playing 'The Ride' at full volume...  Bob Parker may have had the duty of choosing this piece. In a February 1992 telephone conversation, Bob said that, if it was he who picked the piece, it was simply because he likes Wagner and can think of few things more stirring than the Ride. He also says that, in the Apollo era, the wake-up music was usually picked the night before and that they sometimes had trouble finding a recording in time.

Groundhog Day's I Got You Babe is a recurring theme for wakeup calls on missions which have been extended an additional two days, with the astronauts having to repeat their deorbit activities each day only to be told that because of bad weather they're going to go through the same tasks again the next day. For commander Ken Cockrell this was his third mission in a row where he's stayed in orbit for an additional two days in the hopes of good weather in Florida. On STS-80 the landing finally cooperated and he landed in Florida, for STS-98 and STS-111 he landed at the alternate site in California.

Her 30 year mission: To seek out new science. To build new outposts. To bring nations together on the final frontier. To boldly go, and do, what no spacecraft has done before. It was a fitting beginning to the day that will see Discovery undock from the space station for the last time.

2011-07-13,SPACE SHUTTLE,STS-135,Elton John,"Rocket Man (I Think It's Going To Be A Long, Long Time)","Flight Day 6 was kick-started for the STS-135 astronauts with a special wake-up message from Elton John and one of the legendary performer's greatest hits. Rocket Man debuted around the time of the Apollo 16 mission, which sent men to the moon for the fifth time. The four-and-a-half minute song, which describes a long-term space bound astronaut's mixed feelings at leaving his family to do his job, has been played to awaken four shuttle crews aboard Discovery and Atlantis. Rocket Man also, one of NASA's top 40 wakeup call songs listed for voter selection during a contest to commemorate the Space Shuttle Discovery and Endeavour's last missions, earned nearly 5,000 votes from the public. The song inspired by space exploration woke up the final space shuttle crew of Atlantis one last time: Good morning Atlantis, this is Elton John. We wish you much success on your mission. A huge thank you to all the men and women at NASA who worked on the shuttle for the last three decades.",Rock,Pop Rock,1972.0,https://api.discogs.com/masters/444775,https://www.discogs.com/Elton-John-Rocket-Man-I-Think-Its-Going-To-Be-A-Long-Long-Time/release/4733658
